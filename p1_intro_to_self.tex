\subsubsection{About me}
I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at Concordia. 
My focus area in the field is Software Systems. 
With the nature of my study, I am eager to learn about the software development process in depth, from developing to shipping the final product.
Before the internship, mostly I was doing personal projects on my own and sometimes in teams to learn and improve my own skill set.
I also enjoy participating in Hackathons since it is a great chance to meet like-minded people and work on something interesting.

\subsubsection{About my role in Theia team}
My role as a Coop Software Developer is to test, investigate bugs, develop, and enhance features in the framework.
Other than that, I also participate in code review for both team members and community contributors.

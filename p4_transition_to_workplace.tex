\subsubsection{Transition}
It took me about 1 week to integrate into the team, and get familiar with the workflow and the codebase.
I still have new things to learn every day, but after that first week, I was more comfortable with working at Ericsson because I understand what resources are available and who to ask when I have questions.
The working style is pretty relaxing, I'm allowed to work on things that are interesting to me, and the team members are there to help in case I got stuck at some points.
All the meetings have never been stressful and everyone is free to express their own opinions.
In addition, both my team lead and my manager are friendly.
All of that has reduced the stress of working and make work time an enjoyable time.

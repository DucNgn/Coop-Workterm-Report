\subsubsection{Transition}
The whole process of me integrating into the team, getting familiar with the workflow and the code base took about 1 week.
I still have new things to learn everyday, but after that first week, I was more comfortable with working at Ericsson because I understand what resources and who to ask.
The working style in the team is relaxing, I'm allowed to work on things that interested to me, and the team members are there to help in case I got stuck at some points.
In overall, I enjoy the workplace culture at Ericsson, all the meetings have never been stressful.

\subsection{Summary}

Fall of 2020, I got the chance to become a software developer intern in the Theia team at Ericsson.
Being a co-op student here was a truly eye-opening experience for me.
It was intimidating at first, working in a big open-source project with nearly 180 active contributors from all around the world.
However, with all the available resources and a helpful, encouraging team, it turned out to be a super valuable learning experience for me.
During the internship, I got to learn and work on many interesting projects with different tools and technologies.
For me, it was never a boring moment and two days are never the same because everything is constantly evolving in the project.
